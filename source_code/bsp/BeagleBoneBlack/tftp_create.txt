sudo apt-get install tftpd

Then, create a file in /etc/xinetd.d/ called tftp and add the following :

# description: The tftp server serves files using the trivial file transfer
#       protocol.  The tftp protocol is often used to boot diskless
#       workstations, download configuration files to network-aware printers,
#       and to start the installation process for some operating systems.


service tftp
{
protocol        = udp
port            = 69
socket_type     = dgram
wait            = yes
#user            = nobody
user            = root
server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
server_args     = /tftpboot
disable         = no
}

And to apply the changes, execute:

sudo service xinetd restart
